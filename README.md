# Useful Source Codes in C\#

This project has some examples of source codes that I use in ERP systems when needed. Bear in mind that these codes are generally for systems developed in Brasil.

## Introduction

The codes presented in this project are:

- [**Holidays**](Utilities/Holidays), with codes for manipulate brazilian and britain holidays;
- [**NTPClient**](Utilities/NTPClient), which shows an example of how to obtain th current date/time directly from the Microsoft servers;
- [**PersonalIDs**](Utilities/PersonalIDs), to validate some documents from Brazil, e.g. RG, CPF and CNPJ;
- [**TextFormat**](TextFormat), for text formatting;
- [**ViaCEP**](ViaCEP), which uses the [ViaCEP](https://viacep.com.br/) webservice to request brazilian CEP's.

They are simple codes, but they may be useful on small daily problems. Finally, you may use only the source codes available on the `sources` folder, if you wish.

## Utilized Material

You may test the above codes using the Visual Studio. For this, it's necessary:

- [**Visual Studio 2017**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or above;
- [**.NET Framework 3.5**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=21) or above, if it's not available with Visual Studio.

## Additional Info

Since this is a work in progress, probably I will add more features in the future. Stay tuned!
